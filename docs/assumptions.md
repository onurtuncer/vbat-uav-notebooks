# Modeling Assumptions

This study intentionally uses **first-order models** appropriate
for early conceptual design.

## Environment
- Sea-level ISA conditions
- Constant air density
- No wind or gusts

## Vehicle
- Rigid airframe
- No aeroelastic effects
- No structural stress modeling

## Propulsion
- Quasi-steady flow
- Lumped efficiency models
- No thermal limits

## Mission
- Fixed mission segments
- No abort or contingency logic

## Design Intent
These assumptions are chosen to expose **dominant scaling effects**
and architectural feasibility.

## Consequences
- Hover power is optimistic
- Cruise power strongly depends on assumed L/D
- Battery mass is likely underestimated
